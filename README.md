# ELP-Screening
High-throughput screening of elastin-like polypeptides for the self-assembly of stable vesicles.

## Contents
### simulation_utility
Contains codes to perform MD, umbrella sampling and WHAM to estimate free energy of association of pre-assembled vesicle.

### GS_cpp
Contains C++ implementation of generic string kernel proposed by Giguère et al.[[1]](#1)

### Others
The other python files are codes to perform Gaussian Process Regression and Bayesian optimization.
